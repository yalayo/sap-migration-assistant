⛅️ wrangler 4.29.1
───────────────────
▲ [WARNING] Processing wrangler.toml configuration:

    - Unexpected fields found in build field: "upload"
    - Unexpected fields found in top-level field: "docker"


▲ [WARNING] Multiple environments are defined in the Wrangler configuration file, but no target environment was specified for the deploy command.

  To avoid unintentional changes to the wrong environment, it is recommended to explicitly specify the target environment using the `-e|--env` flag.
  If your intention is to use the top-level environment of your configuration simply pass an empty string to the flag to target such environment. For example `--env=""`.

  If so, try adding `export default { ... }` in your entry-point.
