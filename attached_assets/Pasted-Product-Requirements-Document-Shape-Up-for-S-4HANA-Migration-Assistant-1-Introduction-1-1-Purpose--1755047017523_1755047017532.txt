The primary users of this system will be:

SAP Customers: Specifically, IT Directors, CIOs, Business Process Owners, and Project Managers contemplating or embarking on an SAP ECC to S/4HANA migration.

Consulting Firms: Who offer S/4HANA migration services and seek a structured tool for client assessment, planning, and execution support.

3. Key Features
3.1 Customer Assessment & Discovery
This feature will guide customers through a series of questions to understand their current SAP landscape, business objectives, and migration readiness.

Requirements:

R1.1: The system shall present a questionnaire covering key aspects of the customer's current SAP ECC infrastructure and strategic intent.

Question Examples:

"What is your current SAP ECC system landscape (e.g., single instance, multiple instances, highly customized)?": This addresses existing SAP usage and legacy complexity.

"What is your desired outcome from the S/4HANA migration (e.g., clean slate, preserve proven business processes, phased modernization)?": This helps determine the strategic imperative (Ref: Section 3.1, S/4HANA Migration Approaches, in the research).

"What is the approximate quality of your current master and transactional data (e.g., very clean, some errors, significant cleanup needed)?": Directly impacts data migration complexity (Ref: Section 3.3, Common Challenges, in the research).

"What is your organization's appetite for change and disruption during the migration (e.g., minimal disruption, open to significant re-engineering)?": Relates to risk tolerance and cultural readiness (Ref: Section 3.1, S/4HANA Migration Approaches, in the research).

"How critical is preserving existing custom code vs. adopting standard S/4HANA functionalities?": Addresses customization compatibility (Ref: Section 5.2, Customization Compatibility & Simplification, in the research).

"What is your rough timeline and budget for the migration project?": Provides context for the "appetite" (Ref: Section 2.2, The Shaping Phase, in the research).

R1.2: The system shall support various input types (e.g., radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, text fields) for structured data collection.

R1.3: The system shall store assessment responses securely, linked to the customer's account.

3.2 Migration Strategy Recommendation

R3.3: The system shall allow users to adjust the suggested resources (e.g., add/remove roles, modify FTE estimates).

3.4 Shape Up Project Creation (Appetite Definition)
This feature allows users to define and create "pitches" for specific migration cycles, defining their "appetite" (fixed time budget).

Requirements:

R4.1: The system shall enable users to create new "pitches" for individual migration work packages or cycles.

R4.2: Each pitch creation form shall include the following fields:

Problem: A concise statement of the enterprise-level challenge being addressed (e.g., "Legacy data structure causes slow financial close") (Ref: Section 4.1, Shaping the Migration Initiative, in the research).

Proposed Solution: A high-level description of the migration chunk or functionality to be delivered (e.g., "Implement new G/L in S/4HANA for parallel accounting") (Ref: Section 4.1, Shaping the Migration Initiative, in the research).

Appetite (Fixed Time): A dropdown or input for defining the fixed duration of the cycle (e.g., 6, 8, 10, 12 weeks), with clear explanations of what each duration typically accommodates for S/4HANA projects (Ref: Section 4.3, Building the S/4HANA Solution, in the research).

Anticipated Business Value: A brief description of the benefits expected from completing this pitch (Ref: Section 4.1, Shaping the Migration Initiative, in the research).

Identified Roadblocks/Unknowns: A free-text field to capture potential complexities identified during shaping (e.g., "complex legacy custom code," "poor data quality in source system") (Ref: Section 4.1, Shaping the Migration Initiative, and Section 5.3, Change Management & User Adoption, in the research).

Dependencies: A multi-select field to link to other pitches or external dependencies.

R4.3: The system shall allow users to associate pitches with the project's overall migration strategy.

R4.4: The system shall provide a conceptual "Betting Table" view where multiple pitches can be reviewed by stakeholders (initial implementation will be a display-only list of pitches with their details).

3.5 Project Tracking (Hill Charts)
This feature will provide a visual representation of project progress for each defined pitch, using the Shape Up Hill Chart model.

Requirements:

R5.1: The system shall display an interactive Hill Chart for each active project.

Visual Representation: Each "pitch" or "work package" (e.g., "Finance Module Configuration," "Historical Data Archiving") shall be represented as a draggable "dot" or "circle" on the hill (Ref: Section 2.4, The Build Cycle, in the research).

Uphill Phase: The "uphill" section of the chart shall represent the "figuring things out" phase, where unknowns are tackled and critical design decisions are made (Ref: Section 4.5, Visualizing Migration Progress with Hill Charts, in the research).

Examples of "Uphill" Activities: Detailed data profiling, custom code analysis, complex integration mapping, in-depth gap analysis, technical feasibility spikes (Ref: Section 4.5).

Downhill Phase: The "downhill" section shall represent the "doing the work" phase, characterized by predictable execution (Ref: Section 4.5, Visualizing Migration Progress with Hill Charts, in the research).

Examples of "Downhill" Activities: Actual data loading, system configuration, development of new functionalities, execution of various testing phases (unit, integration, UAT), deployment activities (Ref: Section 4.5).

R5.2: Users shall be able to update the status of each work package by moving its corresponding dot on the Hill Chart (e.g., from "Uphill" to "Downhill").

R5.3: The system shall provide clear visual indicators of progress (e.g., color changes, labels).

R5.4: The Hill Chart shall highlight work packages that appear "stuck" in the uphill phase for an extended period, prompting proactive support from managers (Ref: Section 2.4, The Build Cycle, in the research).

4. User Flows/Scenarios
4.1 New Customer Onboarding & Strategy Recommendation:

A new customer visits the platform.

They are prompted to complete the Customer Assessment & Discovery questionnaire.

Upon submission, the system processes the answers and presents a Migration Strategy Recommendation (e.g., Greenfield, Brownfield, or Hybrid) with a detailed explanation of its suitability and how Shape Up applies.

The system then presents the recommended Resource Planning & Allocation for their project.

The customer reviews the recommendation and is given the option to "Start Project" to begin defining their first Shape Up pitches.

4.2 Project Manager Creating a New Migration Cycle:

A Project Manager logs into an existing project.

They navigate to the "Pitches" or "Cycles" section.

They click "Create New Pitch" and fill out the form, defining the Problem, Proposed Solution, Appetite (Fixed Time), Anticipated Business Value, Identified Roadblocks, and Dependencies.

The new pitch is added to the project's conceptual "Betting Table."

4.3 Team Member Updating Work Package Progress:

A team member (e.g., Data Specialist, ABAP Developer) logs in and views their assigned "pitches" or "work packages."

They navigate to the project's Hill Chart.

They interact with the dot representing their work package, moving it along the hill to reflect its current status (e.g., from early "Uphill" after initial analysis to "Mid-Uphill" when encountering complex data quality issues, or to "Downhill" once a clear plan is in place for execution).

The Hill Chart updates in real-time for all stakeholders.

5. Technical Considerations (High-Level)
Frontend Framework: React.js for building a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) with reusable components.

Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI design, adhering to Material Design aesthetics.

Charting Libraries:

Chart.js: For visualizing the Hill Chart (custom rendering on canvas) and potentially other high-level project dashboards (e.g., risk mitigation, cycle breakdown).

Plotly.js: Potentially for more complex data distributions from assessment, if deemed necessary, configured for Canvas/WebGL rendering (NO SVG).

Backend & Database: Google Firestore for robust, scalable data persistence.

Data Structure: Collections for users, assessments, projects, pitches, and hillChartItems.

User Data: Private data stored under /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/....
